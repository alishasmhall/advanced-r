## Eurovision data

We chose to investigate 2022 data from Tanya Shapiro about the Eurovision Song Contest: <https://github.com/tashapiro/eurovision-contest>.

```{r import-data, echo = TRUE}

# Packages
  library(tidyr)
  library(dplyr)
  library(ggplot2)

# Set theme for all following graphs
  theme_set(theme_bw())

# Read in two datasets and create dataframes
  # tuesdata <-   tidytuesdayR::tt_load('2022-05-17')
  # eurovision <- tuesdata[["eurovision"]]
  # votes <-      tuesdata[["eurovision-votes"]]
  # save(eurovision, votes, file = "/Users/au734169/Documents/01_PhD/Advanced_R/eurovision.rda")
  load(file = "/Users/au734169/Documents/01_PhD/Advanced_R/eurovision.rda")
  
# Explore data
  knitr::kable(votes[1:10,])
  knitr::kable(eurovision[1:10,])
  # str(votes)
  # str(eurovision)

```

## Who won?
Question: Who won the Eurovision Song Contest each year? Was there always one winner?

```{r winners, echo = TRUE}  
  
# Who are the winners of the contest each year?   
  winners <- eurovision %>% 
    filter(winner == TRUE & section %in% c("final", "grand-final")) %>% 
    select(year, host_country, section, winner, artist, artist_country, total_points) %>% 
    arrange(year) # %>% 
    # nrow()
  # There are 69 rows in the dataset.

  knitr::kable(winners[1:10,])
  
# Who are the winning countries?
  ggplot(data = winners,
         aes(x = forcats::fct_infreq(artist_country))) +
           geom_bar() +
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90)) +
    labs(title = "Number of wins per country",
         x = "Country",
         y = "Number of wins")
  
# How many distinct years are present in the dataset?  
  eurovision %>% 
    distinct(year) %>% 
    nrow()
  # There are 67 distinct years in the dataset.
  
# Are there any years with 0 winners?
    winners %>% 
      distinct(year) %>% 
      pull(year) %>%  # creates a vector from a column
      setdiff(c(1956:2022), .) # get all rows in x that are not in y
    # There was no winner in 2020 because the contest had to be stopped due to COVID-19 :(
  
# Are there any years with >1 winner?  
  winners %>% 
    group_by(year) %>% 
    filter(n()>1) %>% 
    knitr::kable(.)
  # Yes, 1969 had 4 winners.
  

```

## Points system
Question: How many points are being distributed each year?

```{r countries, echo = TRUE} 

# Calculate the total number of points for each year
  points <- eurovision %>% 
    group_by(year) %>% 
    filter(section %in% c("final", "grand-final")) %>% 
    summarize(total_points_year = sum(total_points, na.rm = TRUE))

# Get the number of countries participating by year
  countries <- eurovision %>% 
    group_by(year) %>% 
    summarize(n_countries_year = n_distinct(artist_country))
  
# Join datasets  
  by_year <- full_join(points, countries, by = "year") %>% 
    mutate(points_per_country = total_points_year/n_countries_year)

# Plot total number of points
  ggplot(data = by_year,
         aes(x = year,
             y = total_points_year,
             size = n_countries_year)) +
    geom_point() +
    labs(title = "Eurovision: Total points to distribute each year", 
         x = "Year", 
         y = "Total points", 
         size = "Participating countries")
  
  ggplot(data = by_year,
         aes(x = year,
             y = points_per_country,
             color = n_countries_year)) +
    geom_point() +
    labs(title = "Eurovision: Points to distribute per country each year", 
         x = "Year", 
         y = "Points to distribute per country", 
         col = "Participating countries")

# Why were no points assigned in 1956?
  eurovision %>% 
    filter(year == 1956) %>% 
    select(event, artist, artist_country, section, total_points, rank, winner) %>% 
    knitr::kable(.)
  # There was no points, only rank = 1 for the winner and rank = 2 for the rest.
  
# Why were no points assigned in 2020?
  eurovision %>% 
    filter(year == 2020) %>% 
    select(event, artist, artist_country, section, total_points, rank, winner) %>% 
    knitr::kable(.)
  # Eurovision was cancelled and no points were assigned because of COVID-19 :(


```

## What proportion of points did the winner get?
Question: What proportion of the total points distributed that year did the winner of the final get?

```{r winners-points, echo = TRUE}  

# What proportion of points did the winners get?
  winners_points <- left_join(winners, by_year, by = "year") %>% 
    mutate(total_points_prop = round((total_points / total_points_year) * 100, 1))
  
# Plot results
  ggplot(data = winners_points, aes(x=year, y=total_points_prop, fill = artist_country)) +
    geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
    labs(title = "Percent of points received by Eurovision winner by year", 
         x = "Year", 
         y = "Points received by winner (%)", 
         fill = "Country of winner")
  

```

## Flow of points from country to country
Question: Which countries are sending votes to each other?

```{r point-flow, echo=TRUE} 

# Create from-to variable
  votes$from_to <- paste(votes$from_country, votes$to_country)

# Get the sum of votes
  sum_votes <- votes %>%
    filter(is.na(duplicate)) %>%
    select(from_to, points) %>%
    group_by(from_to) %>%
    summarise(sum_points = sum(points)) %>%
    separate(from_to, c("From", "To"))
  
# Plot flow of points within countries that received at least 250 points
  ggplot(data = filter(sum_votes, sum_points > 250),
         aes(x = From,
             y = To)) +
    geom_raster(aes(fill = sum_points)) +
    scale_fill_viridis_c(direction = -1) +
    labs(title = "Eurovision point distribution over the years 1956 - 2022 (>250 points)",
         x = "From country",
         y = "To country",
         fill = "Total points \n from country \n to country") +
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90))
  
# Plot flow of points within countries that received at least 400 points
  ggplot(data = filter(sum_votes, sum_points > 400),
         aes(x = From,
             y = To)) +
    geom_raster(aes(fill = sum_points)) +
    scale_fill_viridis_c(direction = -1) +
    labs(title = "Eurovision point distribution over the years 1956 - 2022 (>400 points)",
         x = "From country",
         y = "To country",
         fill = "Total points \n from country \n to country") +
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90))

```

```{r correlation, eval = FALSE, include = FALSE} 

# Read in extra package
  library(corrr)

# Filter dataset
  votes_small <- votes %>% 
    filter(is.na(duplicate) & semi_final == "f" & year == 2022) %>% 
    select(from_country, to_country, points) %>% 
    rename(country1 = from_country, country2 = to_country)

# How many unique combinations are in the dataset?
  votes_small %>% 
    distinct(country1, country2) %>% 
    nrow()
  # 975 unique combinations (dataframe is twice as long)
  
# How many countries are giving vs. receiving points in the final?  
  votes_small %>% 
    summarize(n_from_country = n_distinct(country1), 
              n_to_country = n_distinct(country2))
  # Only 25 of 40 participating countries received points in the final in 2022
  # That means that 15 countries cannot possibly receive points (because not in final).
  
# Merge to get four columns with bidirectional points between country pairs  
  test <- left_join(votes_small, votes_small, join_by(country2==country1, country1==country2)) %>% 
    distinct(country1, country2, .keep_all = TRUE) %>% 
    rename(points_1_to_2 = points.x, points_2_to_1 = points.y) %>% 
    mutate(country_diff = points_1_to_2 - points_2_to_1)

```
